# World_Weather_Analysis

Client requested updates on the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data.
The weather description data was used to enhance the PlanMyTrip app.Input statements were imbedded to filter the data for weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Four cities were chosen from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Using the Geoapify Routing API, a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map were created.
